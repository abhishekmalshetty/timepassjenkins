I have been an integral part of the IT industry for the past 8 years, dedicating my professional journey to the realm of DevOps. Over the years, I have particularly honed my expertise in the domain of Microsoft Azure, although my roots were initially planted in the Linux terrain.

My extensive experience with Azure has seen me navigating through its extensive suite of services. I am well-versed with Azure's offerings such as Resource Group, Storage Account, Function App, Application Insights, Key Vault, Vnet/Subnet, App Service Plan, Event Hub, and Event Grid. One of my crowning achievements was leading a team in the deployment of Java Spring Boot Azure Function Apps, seamlessly integrating them with the larger ecosystem of Azure services, from EventHub to databases.

On the infrastructure front, I have been pivotal in creating and updating our company's backbone using Terraform scripts. This ensures that our production and other environments maintain a harmonious synchronization. My foray into CI/CD saw me orchestrating migrations to GitHub Actions, establishing resilient pipelines in Azure DevOps.

Monitoring is a critical aspect of any robust system, and I've placed a special emphasis on this throughout my career. Using tools like Application Insights, I have ensured that our applications are continuously observed, reporting valuable data that can be used to optimize performance and predict potential issues.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) has been one of the focal points of my work in recent years. My hands-on involvement with AKS encompasses tasks ranging from deploying containerized applications to writing Terraform modules tailored for AKS resources management.

In terms of security – a paramount concern in today's digital landscape – I have collaborated with elite security architects, formulating stringent cloud security frameworks. Our reliance on Azure Key Vault, with its advanced versioning, key rotation, and hardware security module (HSM) features, has been instrumental in reinforcing our defense mechanisms.

Beyond Azure, my responsibilities also extended to tools and platforms that complement it. For instance, I've used Jenkins extensively, optimizing multiple areas such as Plugin Management, Performance, and integrating Code Analysis tools to furnish a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

Our team always believed in an agile methodology, and tools like Jira were our constant companions. From jotting down requirements to tracing the progress of assigned tasks, our development cycles were always backed by meticulous documentation and tracking.

As I reflect on my 8-year journey, the constant factor has been my unwavering dedication to not just mastering the tools and platforms but also fostering a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation. Azure has been a significant part of this journey, and I look forward to the many more milestones ahead.

Over the past 8 years, I've deeply immersed myself in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. I'm well-versed with Azure's core features like Resource Groups, Storage Accounts, and Function Apps. Additionally, I've worked extensively with Application Insights for monitoring, Key Vault for securing application secrets, and managed networking through Vnet/Subnet configurations."

Interviewer: "How about your DevOps experience specifically related to system setup, deployment, and monitoring?"

You: "In my previous roles, I took on significant DevOps responsibilities. I've set up DEV, QA, and PROD back-end systems, ensuring they align with both organizational and departmental standards. I've been involved with applications in the Loyalty Systems domain, where I ensured seamless deployment and continuous monitoring."

Interviewer: "What can you tell us about your experience with Java Spring Boot Azure Function Apps and related cloud infrastructure?"

You: "Absolutely! I've been part of several projects that leveraged Java Spring Boot for Azure Function Apps. I ensured these applications were integrated seamlessly with Azure's cloud infrastructure, especially with services like EventHub. Moreover, I've built robust connections to on-premise infrastructures, maintaining the synergy between cloud and traditional setups."

Interviewer: "How familiar are you with infrastructure automation using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines?"

You: "I believe automation is the backbone of any successful DevOps strategy. I've employed Terraform scripts multiple times to create and update infrastructure, ensuring environments like PROD mirror our intended configurations. When it comes to CI/CD, I have experience with both Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. I've also been part of several migration projects transitioning pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions."

Interviewer: "Finally, how do you ensure application performance and seamless deployment tracking?"

You: "Monitoring application health is crucial. I always ensure our applications report to Application Insights. This gives us an edge in detecting issues early and addressing them promptly. In terms of SLAs, I configure alerts to notify the right on-call teams to ensure quick action. And lastly, I've always made sure that every deployment gets registered automatically with our deployment tracking systems, ensuring transparency and traceability throughout our deployment processes."

Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing service that offers a multitude of features and services. Let's dive into a brief description of the mentioned features:

Resource Group: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It's a way to manage and organize related Azure resources.

Storage Account: Provides scalable and secure storage for Azure services like virtual machines, file shares, and more.

Function App: Part of Azure Functions, it's a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without having to manage infrastructure.

Application Insights: A performance and application monitoring service that allows developers to detect, triage, and diagnose issues in web apps and services.

Key Vault: A cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets such as API keys, passwords, or certificates.

Vnet/Subnet: Virtual Network (VNet) is a network within Azure, and subnets are segments of a VNet's IP address range where you can allocate a portion of the VNet's IP address space to each of the subnets.

App Service Plan: Defines the region (Datacenter) of the physical server where your web application will be hosted and determines the amount of storage, RAM, and CPU capacity.

Event Hub: A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service that can receive and process millions of events per second.

Event Grid: A cloud service that provides event routing and filtering capabilities, enabling serverless event architectures.

Triggers (Blob/HTTP/Timer/Service Bus): These are conditions or events that automatically run Azure Functions. For instance, an HTTP Trigger would run a function whenever an HTTP request is made to the function's endpoint.

PowerShell Scripting: Azure supports automation with PowerShell, allowing you to script operations on Azure resources.

ARM Templates: Azure Resource Manager templates are JSON files that define the resources you need to deploy for your solution, allowing for infrastructure as code and repeatable deployments.

Slot Deployment: In Azure App Services, slots enable you to host different versions of your web app. This is beneficial for staging environments, testing, and other scenarios.
